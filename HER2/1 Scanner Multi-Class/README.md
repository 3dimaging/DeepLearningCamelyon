# This is the First pass at the HER2 Multi-class single scanner test


Need to evaluate:
1. Why is accuracy 1 for every fold for every scanner?
2. Why does each epoch run to 241? Shouldn't it run to 193? (4/5 of 241)
3. When we change around some of the darker images from folder 3 to folder 1, does that effect predictability? It should bring accuracy down - does it?
4. Is there a way to predict accuracy with greater than 2 significant figures? This could also be our problem.



There is surely something wrong here. We will conduct testing and training to evaluate the issue.
