## 0 - Preparation
### 0.1 Set up deep learning environment.

- [Setup Python Environment](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/0%20-%20Preparation/Seup%20Machine%20Learning%20Environment.py)

- [Python IDE](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/0%20-%20Preparation/Python%20IDE%20(Emacs%20%2B%20Org%20%2B%20Ob-iPython))
  ![alt text](https://github.com/3dimaging/Accessory/blob/master/destopshot.png)
  
- [Package Installation for Color Normalization](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/0%20-%20Preparation/Staintools)
- [Singularity for reproducibility](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/0%20-%20Preparation/Singularity)
        


### 0.2 ASAP installation and image display

- [ASAP Installation](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/0%20-%20Preparation/ASAP%20installation%20(Ubuntu%2016.04))
- [OpenSlide Installation](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/0%20-%20Preparation/OpenSlide%20Installation)


Compare the ASAP with OpenSlide: ASAP doesn’t have detailed manual to describe its commands; OpenSlide has a much better document for its commands. ASAP has a GUI; OpenSlide doesn’t   
   
### 0.3 Mask file generation

- Mask file is the ground truth for model training. Mask file has the exact same dimensions as its corresponding WSI image.  Mask file is a binary file with normal tissue coded as ‘0’ and tumor tissue coded as ‘1’ for each corresponding pixel of WSI image. 
- [Mask file generation](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/1%20-%20WSI%20Visualization%20with%20Annotation/Mask%20Generation)
- However, the code provided by the organizer is misleading. The mask file generated by the code from their paper is all ‘0’; then another piece of code suggested generated mask file that can be open only by ASAP GUI, not by its command line and OpenSlide.
- Time consuming

## 2 - Image Preprocess

### 2.1 Image Segmentation

To reduce computation, the blank regions (no tissue) on slide will be excluded.

- Color space switch to HSV
- Tissue region segmentation (Otsu’s method of foreground segmentation)


### 2.2 Patch Extraction


#### Step 1 : Randomly extract patches (256 x 256) on the tissue region at the level of 40x
               
		Tumor slide : 1K positive and 1K negative from each slide

		Normal slide: 1K negative from each slide
            

#### Step 2 : Crop 224x224 patches and conduct image augmentation

-- step 2: Negative Mining


Extract additional training patches from false positive regions

## 4 - Prediction and Evaluation
### 4.1 Make predictions and construct heatmaps

Test images were divided into non-overlapping small patches; each patch will get a predicted image for each pixel assigned by probability.
Heatmap is a way to display the probability 

 - [Code for prediction - googlenet](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/4%20-%20Prediction%20and%20Evaluation/Prediction_googlenet.py)
 - [Code for prediction - FCN and U-net](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/4%20-%20Prediction%20and%20Evaluation/Prediction_fcn_unet.py)


Put all the patches together and get prediction for the whole slide ([code for heatmap generation based on predicted values](https://github.com/DIDSR/DeepLearningCamelyon/blob/master/4%20-%20Prediction%20and%20Evaluation/Heatmap_generation.py)).

### 4.2a Slide-based Classification


Extracting Features for whole-slide image classification task

#### Global Features Extraction

1. The ratio between the area of metastatic regions and the tissue area.
2. The sum of all cancer metastases probailities detected in the metastasis identification task, divided by the tissue area. 
caculate them at 5 different thresholds (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9), so the total 10 global features

#### Local Features Extraction 

Based on 2 largest metastatic candidate regions (select them based on a threshold of 0.5).

9 features were extracted from the 2 largest regions:

1. Area: the area of connected region
2. Eccentricity: The eccentricity of the ellipse that has the same second-moments as the region
3. Extend: The ratio of region area over the total bounding box area
4. Bounding box area
5. Major axis length: the length of the major axis of the ellipse that has the same normalized second central moments as the region
6. Max/mean/min intensity: The max/mean/minimum probability value in the region
7. Aspect ratio of the bounding box
8. Solidity: Ratio of region area over the surrounding convex area
